The section provides examples of solving various equations using QuDynamics. Use [Binder](http://mybinder.org/) to play around instantly, preloaded with QuDynamics, QuBase packages and PyPlot, Gadfly packages for plotting. Jupyter is the medium allowing notebooks, terminal interface.

Currently we have the following two examples :

1. Quantum Harmonic Oscillator
2. Jaynes Cummings Model

We would like to thank QuTiP developers for sharing the Jaynes Cummings Model, the
current implementation is a direct porting of QuTiP JC model to QuDynamics version.

Here are some QuDynamics versions (with results) and their QuTiP references :

* Implementation of Jaynes Cummings Model

  *  [QuDynamics version](https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/QuDynamics.jl/blob/master/examples/notebooks/JC_Model_QuTiP_in_QuDynamics.ipynb)

   * [QuTiP version](https://github.com/qutip/qutip-notebooks/blob/master/examples/example-JC-model-wigner-function.ipynb)

* Implementation of Jaynes Cummings Model using Quantum Monte Carlo Wave Function Method

   * [QuDynamics version](https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/QuDynamics.jl/blob/master/examples/notebooks/JC_Model_QuTiP_in_QuDynamics_MCWF_method.ipynb)

   * [QuTiP reference](http://qutip.org/docs/3.1.0/guide/dynamics/dynamics-monte.html)
